## Configuring Thunderbird

### From a Fresh Install
* Would you like a new email address?
  * skip and use my existing email
* Your name (as it is displayed to others)
* Email address: callsign@winlink.org
* password: ?
* Now Thunderbird will go out & try & find settings for this account.
  * It should fail, that's OK
* Server hostname: Incoming
* Select "Add other account"
  * movemail account
  * Outgoing SMTP: localhost
* Need to set Message Storage Local directory properly:
  * Defaults to /home/<user>/.thunderbird/something.default/Mail/localhost


### Second attempt
* Your name: <Your name as seen by others>
